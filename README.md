# Vibe-Codding A Python UDP Based Share-Screen App

---

This whole this was made with ducttape, glue, and Gemini's help... 🙃
I'm not going to update this, to me it's fine as-is... there isn't much to do rather then actually make sure the code is clean, and go over it to make it better where possible with your own skills. 🤷‍♂️

Just whanted to try the whole "vibe-coding" thing, and had the Idea for a python-based udp screen share application from a class in cyber security I had during college.

If anyone out there has a similar exercise - feel free to use this as a base if you'd like 👍

(I honestlly made the release, and only then thought it'll be a good idea to include a README file just in case... 👉😎👉)
